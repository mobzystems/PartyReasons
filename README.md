# Party Reason Generator
This React-app shows good (and not-so-good) reasons to throw a party. Enter some names and dates
and the app wil show a list of dates in a year with a reason to throw a party. Each reason has 
a "Quality", ranging from "Fantastic" (50 years old, 50.000 days) to "Awful" (2.100 weeks).

## Work in progress
This is a work in progress. TODO:

- Edit names and dates
- Distinguish between names and dates. This also means displaying events differently, e.g. "50 years ago" vs "50 years old". Also, some combinations make no sense (a birth date and an event?)
- Handle future dates (e.g. ages <0)
- Better mobile support
- Use checkbox in header to select all or none
- Saving groups of dates (e.g. "families"?) Idea: save as JSON using the underlying function app
- Remove duplicate reasons (e.g. 0 weeks, 0 days)
- Add Explain button
- Add icons

## Try it out!
