# Party Reason Generator
This React-app shows good (and not-so-good) reasons to throw a party. Enter some names and dates
and the app wil show a list of dates in a year with a reason to throw a party. Each reason has 
a "Quality", ranging from "Fantastic" (50 years old, 50.000 days) to "Awful" (2.100 weeks).

## Work in progress
This is a work in progress. TODO:

- Edit names and dates
- Handle actual dates (e.g. age = 0 days)
- Better mobile support
- Saving groups of dates (e.g. "families"?) Idea: save as JSON using the underlying function app
- Remove duplicate reasons (e.g. 0 weeks, 0 days)
- Add Explain button

## Try it out!
